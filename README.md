PROJECT OBJECTIVE:- 

This project aims at analyzing trends on Twitter using Python. Twitter’s API allows us to do complex queries like pulling every tweet about a certain topic within the last twenty minutes, or pull a certain user’s non tweets. A simple application of this could be analyzing how our company or an important issue is received in the general public. 
We can collect the last 2,000 tweets that mention our company (or any term you like), and run a sentiment analysis algorithm over it.
We can also target users that specifically live in a certain location, which is known as spatial data.
Another application of this could be to map the areas across the globe where our company has been mentioned the most.


APPROACH:- 

This trend analysis is done in the following manner:-
•	Data is collected with help of the “Tweepy” API available on the twitter platform.
•	Analyzing the tweets with the help of 
Python, NLTK(Natural Language Processing Kit)
•	Performing Sentiment Analysis
•	By analyzing Time Series analysis (Visualizing data with Mat Plot Lib(numpy) in python)

ACHIEVEMENT:-

I performed an analysis on the tweets related to  “COVID-19”. We were successful in understanding the point of view of general public. This inference can be used in improving the relationship of companies with their customers.

TECHNOLOGIES AND TOOLS USED :-

-> Python (Programming Language) 
-> Tweepy Python Library to access twitter API.
-> Natural Language Processing (NLP)
-> MatPlotLib(numpy)
-> Python tool Pandas
-> Folium to visualize data and Leaflet.js to display that data into maps.

USE CASE :-

Public Feedback :- 

The huge analysis  made on the tweets  helped to  get the views of people on various important issues like their thoughts regarding  “Covid-19” pandemic, etc.

We can easily get an idea about how people are reacting to any new Act or Law proposed by Government so that it can be modified according to the public needs.  
The opinion of the people can  be used to implement new reforms in the society. It can help to change the society for the betterment. 

Improvement of image of a company worldwide :- 

By analyzing the  location of the tweets we can easily get an idea about the image of a company around the world.
If  people are  talking about an Indian company or its products outside India as well then this information can be used wisely to promote the company worldwide and this will contribute immensely to the country’s economy.
